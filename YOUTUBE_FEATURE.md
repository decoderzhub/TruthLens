### Updated Pitch:

> "The platform can analyze videos **three ways**:
> 1. Upload files directly

> 3. Batch processing (for multiple videos)
>
> This means your analysts can monitor social media, check viral videos, and verify propaganda **without any manual downloads**. Just copy the URL and get instant analysis."
