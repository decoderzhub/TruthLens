## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Model Won't Load:

**Error:** "Could not load ML model"

**Solution 1 - Internet Required:**
```bash
# Model downloads from HuggingFace on first run
# Make sure you have internet connection
# Wait 2-3 minutes for download
```

**Solution 2 - Manual Install:**
```bash
pip install --upgrade transformers torch torchvision
python -c "from transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification; AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained('dima806/deepfake_vs_real_image_detection')"
```

**Solution 3 - Fallback Mode:**
If ML model fails to load, the system automatically falls back to heuristic methods. You'll see:
```
‚ö†  AI Model: DISABLED (Heuristics only)
   Accuracy: 50-70%
```

### Out of Memory:

**Error:** "CUDA out of memory" or system crashes

**Solution:**
```python
# Edit main.py, add these lines after model loading:
import torch
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

# Or force CPU mode:
device = "cpu"  # Instead of auto-detect
```

### Slow Performance:

**Issue:** Analysis takes too long

**Solutions:**
1. **Use GPU if available** (10x faster)
2. **Reduce image size** before analysis
3. **Batch processing** for multiple files
4. **Add caching** for repeated analyses
